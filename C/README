The configure script will directly work on Linux.  

Mac OS X requires at least

source forMacOSWihtout_pkg_config

but may have other issues.





j

The build puts executables in adestest/C/bin.   These executables
rely being able to read /path/to/adestest/xml/... and /path/to/adestest/xslt/...
to pick up files.      



To Build:

for Macs:  source forMacOSWithout_pkg_config

run ./configure to make Makefile.config.

cd to src/ and run "make" to build.  Binaries will be put in /bin.


To Remove:

make clean -- cleans up src/ area
make realclean -- also removes binaries from bin/
