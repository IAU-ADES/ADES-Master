   """ decodeInitial80ColumnLine breaks an initial 80-col line in MPC
       format into its constituent parts and types.  The type may mean
       the next line is a continuation

       Input:  A line in 80-col format.  This is padded with spaces by 
               the caller

       Output:  A tuple:
           permid: Permanent ID or ''
           provid: Provisional ID, temporary ID, or ''
           disc:   '*" (for discovery) or ''
           note:   1-character note or program code
           code:   This is an overloaded character.  
                   'V/v' means a roving observation with a second record.  
                   'R/r' means a radar observation with a second record.
                   'S/s' means a satellite observation
                   'O' means an offset observation (used only for natural satellites)
                   'E' means an occultation-derived observation
                   other values mean other things.  Black and 'P' mean the same thing
           date:  date of observtion in 'YYYY MM DD.dddddd' format.  The number of 'd's 
                  is important so this is returned as a string.
           ra:    observed j2000.0 ra in 'HH MM SS.ddd' format.  The number if 'd's is
                  so this is returned as a string
           decl:  observed j2000.0 dec in 'sDD MM SS.dd' format.  The 's' is +, -, or 
                  ' ' which means +.  The number of 'd's is important
           mag:   Observed magnitude
           band:  band for observed magnitude
           observatory:   three-character observatory code

       Exceptions:  raises "Invalid MPC80COL line (<reason>): <line> " is the line 
                    is not valid for some reason
