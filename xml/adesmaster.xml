This file contains a meta-description of the ADES formats, with
documentation.  Various .xslt files are used to convert this
file into .xsd files, programs, and other things.

This meta file contains the folowing hierarchy:

XSDTypes -- describes simple, complex and group xsd types

   simpletype -- simple type, with restrictions
      attributes:  
        name: name of type
        base: name of base type
      children:
        restrict: describes a restriction
            name: type of restriction
            value: value field for restriction
        doc: A documentation string
        Example:
           &lt;simpletype name="String" base="xsd:string"&gt;
               &lt;restrict name="xsd:pattern" value="[^|]*[\w-[|]][^|]*"/&gt;
              &lt;doc&gt; String follows the 
                    ADES specification that that the pipe character is disallowed in PSV.
                    To allow data conversion from XML, it must disallowed in XML as well.
                    Also disallow blank elements.  Therefore, all elements must match
                    this pattern &lt;/doc&gt;
           &lt;/simpletype&gt;

           becomes

           &lt;xsd:simpleType name="String"&gt;
               &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;
                 &lt;xsd:documentation&gt;
                    String follows the
                    ADES specification that that the pipe character is disallowed in PSV.
                    To allow data conversion from XML, it must disallowed in XML as well.
                    Also disallow blank elements.  Therefore, all elements must match
                    this pattern
                 &lt;/xsd:documentation&gt;
               &lt;/xsd:annotation&gt;
               &lt;xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"&gt;
                   &lt;xsd:pattern value="[^|]*[\w-[|]][^|*"/&gt;
              &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
           &lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;



   complextype -- complex type 
   grouptype -- makes a group

   Note: Not all possible complex and group types can be defined
         with this format -- only the simplified ones used by
         the ADES project.  If you can't define your new type with
         this format, you probably don't need it anyway.

         choice|sequence|all use="unbounded"    -- sub-elements which  may be nested
                  The "unbounded" attribute puts maxOccurs="unbounded" on the element
                  which is useful for sequence and choice

         The entire xsd syntax is not available but a useful subset is.

         attribute name="name" type="type" [use="requiredAttribute"]
                The default for attributes is optional.  If an attribute is
                required, it must be translated as 'use="required"' which
                is what requiredAttribute turns into.
         
      grouptype  name="groupName"        -- a group declaration
                                             name is usually just "name"
         choice|sequence|all use="unbounded"    -- sub-elements which  may be nested
                  The "unbounded" attribute puts maxOccurs="unbounded" on the element
                  which is useful for sequence and choice

            element|group                       -- elements or groups making up the
                                                   choice, sequence or all elemnt.
         The entire xsd syntax is not available but a useful subset is.


   XSDElementTypes
      element name="name" type="NameType" [use="unbounded"|"optional"|"NoSubmitDistribRequired"|"NoSubmit"
         creates an element with name "name" out of type "NameType" 
         The use attribute
            if it's missing -- a required element
            "unboudned"     -- maxOccurs="unboudned"
            "optional"      -- minOccurs="0"
            "NoSubmitDistribRequired"   -- selects one of the above based on the xslt
                               marks an element as "required for distribution
                               but disallowed otherwise"
            "NoSubmit"   -- selects one of the above based on the xslt
                               marks an element as "optional for distribution
                               but disallowed otherwise"
      element ref="rname" [use="unbounded"|"optional"|"NoSubmitDistribRequired"|"NoSubmit"
          creates an element with name "rname" referring to another element
          The use attribute is the same as above


      group behaves the same as element, but ordinarily is used ref="groupTypeID"
            avoiding the "name" attribute variation.  That's because complextypes
            are used for multiple elements but a group is only used as a component
            of some other type

      --&gt; Typical usage:
      
         A simple restricted type RAType is used to make elements "ra" and "raStar",
         which then appear via ref= in other types


          &lt;simpletype name="RAType"&gt;
             &lt;restriction base="xsd:decimal"&gt;
               &lt;restrict name="xsd:minInclusive" value="0.0"/&gt;
               &lt;restrict name="xsd:maxExclusive" value="360.0"/&gt;
             &lt;restriction&gt;
             &lt;doc&gt; RA in Degrees limited to [0.0, 360.0) &lt;doc&gt;
          &lt;simpletype&gt;
    
         &lt;element name="ra"       type="RAType"              doc="Observation RA in degrees"/&gt;
         &lt;element name="raStar"   type="RAType"              doc="RA of Star in degrees"/&gt;

         &lt;element ref="ra"          /&gt;
         &lt;element ref="raStar"      /&gt;
   PSVObservationFields
       The PSV format order and format is controlled by this block.
       The order is the order of the tags.  The tags look like this:

       <psv tagtype="optical" name="notes"     width="5"  justification="L"  dpos="0"/>

       where tagtype = element of enclosing element (so "optical" and "offset" may be different)
             name    = element name.
             width   = default element width  If line-up is requiested this will
                       be adjusted to fit.
             justification = "L" (left), "R" (right), "C" (center) "D" (decimal)
             dpos = "0" for "C", "L" or "R".  For "D", it is the possion of the decimal
                    point from the left side of the field.  This allows decimal
                    points to be aligned.   This is the default value; if line-up
                    is requested this will be adjusted to fit.

   Notes on use attribute
      The "use" attribute determines whether a give element is required, optional or forbidden.  

      Valid values are:
        -not present-  exactly one must be present 
        'optional'     0 or 1 must be present
        'unbounded'    1 or more must be present
        'NoSubmitDistribRequired'  none must be present for submissions; exactly one for distributions; optional for general
        'NoSubmit'  none must be present for submissions; may be present for distributions; optional for general
        'requiredAttribute'  for attributes only; adds 'use="required"' for that attribute.

        Think of this as F(orbidden), O(optional), R(equired), U(nbounded)

        Then we have this table:

                                 submit    distrib    general
        -not present-              R          R         R
        'optional'                 O          O         O
        'unbounded'                U          U         U
        'NoSubmitDistribRequired'  F          R         O
        'NoSubmit'                 F          O         O

        we may also need  
           ROO  (for logSNR required in new submissions
           FOO  (optional in distrib)
           FUU  (unbounded in distrib)

        Note nothing can be F in general (just leave it out)
        The only way to be R in general is to be R in both submit and distrib
  
        If you want '0 or more must be present,' such as for a list of names, use complexType construct
        like NameType (which is an 'unbounded' list of names) and then an element like 'collaborators'
        where a NameType is optional.  Then 'collaborators' is one or more names.

<section name="Introduction">
   <text>
This document proposes an Astrometry Data Exchange Standard for small solar system objects, e.g., asteroids, comets, and natural satellites. It is intended to be proposed for adoption by IAU Commission 20 (Position and Motion of Minor Planets, Comets and Satellites) at the IAU General Assembly to be held in August 2015. For the purpose of this document we will refer to this standard as IAU2015.

In this document we propose a definition of data types/records that will facilitate transmission and storage of astrometric data, as generated by the observers, stored by the MPC, and processed by the orbit computers. In subsequent extensions to the standard we may propose also data types/record structures to handle other data products, e.g., orbits and ephemerides.

The standard defines certain data types, which are detailed lists of information that either can or must be included in data submission, storage and exchange. These lists can be thought of either as records, such as the ones in a database, or as object classes, user defined data types, and so on. However, the standard defines the information content, not how these structures are implemented in computer codes handling the data.

The proposed standard is based on an initiative undertaken starting in mid-2014 by S. R. Chesley (JPL), D. Farnocchia (JPL), A. Milani (Univ. Pisa), and F. Spoto (SpaceDyS). The standard was discussed with invited representatives of the interested community during a workshop hosted by the MPC on May 7 and 8, 2015. The MPC workshop attendees were

\begin{itemize}
\item	A. B. Chamberlin (JPL)
\item	S. R. Chesley (JPL, IAU Comm. 20 President)
\item	E. Christensen (Univ. Arizona, Catalina Sky Survey)
\item	P. W. Chodas (JPL, NASA NEO Program Office Manager)
\item	L. Denneau (IfA, Univ. Hawaii, ATLAS \&amp; Pan-STARRS)
\item	D. Farnocchia (JPL)
\item	J. L. Galache (CfA, MPC) 
\item	T. Grav (PSI, NEO-WISE)
\item	M. J. Holman (CfA, MPC Interim Director)
\item	S. Keys (CfA, MPC)
\item	R. S. McMillan (Univ. Arizona, Spacewatch)
\item	M. Micheli (ESA ESRIN, SpaceDys)
\item	A. Milani (Univ. Pisa, NEODyS, IAU Comm. X.2, incoming President)
\item	M. Rudenko (CfA, MPC)
\item	G. B. Valsecchi (INAF, IAU Div. F President) 
\item	G. Williams (CfA, MPC Assoc. Director)
\end{itemize}

Following the May workshop a June 1 draft of the standard, representing a consensus among the attendees as the best path forward, was distributed to a somewhat broader group for feedback. The present draft includes additional feedback from the workshop attendees, as well as from Serge Chastel, Jon Giorgini, Bill Gray, Robert Jedicke, Mario Juric, Herbert Raab, Dave Tholen and Brian Warner.

<section name="Motivation">
   <text>
The MPC already has a standard format, referred to as MPC1992, and a message protocol for receiving astrometry, and it uses the same format to redistribute the data to users. This format is limited to 80 columns and comes with limitations such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item	No characterization of astrometric and photometric errors;
\item	Insufficient precision in time and angle fields;
\item	Lack of flexibility and extensibility.
\end{itemize}

The purpose of this standard is to ensure that useful and available observational information is submitted, permanently stored, and disseminated as needed. Availability of more complete information will allow orbit computers to process the data more correctly, leading to better accuracy and reliability. In this way it will be possible to fully exploit the ever improving accuracy and increasing number of both optical and radar observations. For instance, the number of optical observations has increased by two orders of magnitudes in recent decades and the accuracy is soon likely to improve by two orders of magnitude over past performance.

<section name="Requirements">
   <text>
The new standard must comply with requirements related to data content and structure and with requirements related to packaging and format. A guiding principle for developing the standard is that implementation and data processing issues are to be decided and managed locally and should not be prescribed beyond what is necessary to efficiently communicate the desired information. Additionally, the standard should clearly discriminate between the data produced by the observers and those that are the output of orbit computers. The requirements for data content and structure are specified in Sections 4 and 5.

The requirements on format are not as strict and may be interpreted as objectives. The packaging and format approach for the standard is described in Sec. 6. As guidelines, the adopted format should have the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item	The number of fields present in a file and their order, should be flexible so that unused fields can be neglected;
\item	Some fields may be mandatory, others optional or encouraged;
\item	The format should be compatible with new fields, perhaps devised for local use and not envisioned by the standard;
\item	The format should be well-suited for computer input/output, ideally with established libraries in modern programming languages; 
\item	The format should be reasonably convenient for human consultation/editing.
\end{itemize}

To achieve the desired flexibility and extensibility, the defined data records include fields that may be either mandatory or optional. Mandatory fields are required and the data record is considered invalid without them. Some optional fields may not be relevant to a particular observation. Other optional fields may be relevant but not available, a situation that will predominate for historical data that have been stored before the adoption of this standard. Also some observers may not be ready to fill new fields, even if such data necessarily exist in their processing procedure. Optional fields may be left blank, possibly to be supplied later if it becomes feasible. Among the optional fields, some are strongly encouraged and failure to provide them might result in de-weighting of the corresponding observations when fitting an orbit to the observations. 

The MPC is responsible for permanently storing and for disseminating the data submitted by the observers. To preserve the exact reported values, the content of all fields, including numeric fields, should be treated as ASCII character strings. Leading and trailing blanks are ignored.

</section>

<section name="Observations">
   <text>
This section lists the data fields that are a part of the various modes of observation, e.g., optical, radar, etc. Observational data submitted and accepted by the MPC must be stored and preserved at the MPC and disseminated to users. Data exchange may have one of three purposes: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observer submission to the MPC, 
\item MPC distribution to data users and 
\item sharing of observational data among observers and data users.
\end{enumerate}
 In the following descriptions some fields are identified as mandatory or optional, and in some cases this depends on whether the exchange is a part of an observer submission or a part of an MPC distribution. Sharing of data among users and observers must generally comply with the observer submission requirements, although observation headers are optional in this case. When observations that have been published by the MPC are subsequently shared among users it is strongly discouraged to strip any fields from the redistributed records. 

The number of digits in the provided measurements should be consistent with the stated or assumed uncertainty. As a guide, observations should be reported with roughly 1.5 significant figures (a factor $\approx$30) beyond the measurement accuracy, and uncertainties should be reported with 2-3 significant figures. Thus observations reported in \si{\degree} that have accuracies in the range 0.03-0.3 \si{\arcsecond} would reasonably be reported with six significant figures past the decimal point. Similarly, photometry with magnitude uncertainties in the range 0.1-1.0 may be reasonably reported to the nearest 0.01 mag. The MPC may reject observations reported with a gratuitous number of digits.

</section>

<subsection name="Optical Observations">
  <text>
An optical observation contains information about the astrometry and optional photometry of an image source. Optical observations are usually assembled in tracklets. A tracklet is a group of observations that are confirmed as belonging to the same object by the observer through direct inspection of the frames (e.g., in a blinking sequence), or by a software package (e.g., via great circle fit). A tracklet is typically a set of 3 to 5 ground-based observations of a moving object over a time span of up to a few hours, or anyway from the same night. 
  </text>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Radar Observations">
  <text>
Radar astrometry is reported as either the time delay or Doppler frequency shift between transmitter and receiver. It is fundamentally different from optical astrometry not only because of the different observable, but also because the individual data points are one-dimensional and of high fractional precision, potentially at the few meter level in accuracy.
  </text>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Note 1">
  <text>
The use of the fields \texttt{permID}, \texttt{provID}, \texttt{trkID}, \texttt{trkSub}, and \texttt{obsID} depends on the designation status of the target and the purpose behind the exchange of data. For all observer submissions to the MPC, at least one of \texttt{permID}, \texttt{provID} or \texttt{trkSub} must be filled. For unlinked submissions to the MPC the \texttt{permID} and \texttt{provID} fields should not be filled and \texttt{trkSub} must include a user-assigned temporary designation, unique within the submission, for each tracklet in the submission. For targeted follow-up or recovery observations the user is encouraged to report the current designation of the target in either the \texttt{permID} or \texttt{provID} field, as the case may be. If an object is numbered then provID should not be filled and will be ignored by the MPC. For targeted follow up with more than one tracklet in the submission, the \texttt{trkSub} field should be used to distinguish the individual tracklets. \texttt{trkID} and \texttt{obsID} are only to be filled by the MPC and must be empty for MPC submissions of new data. Observers may submit corrections to published observations, in which case the \texttt{obsID} published by the MPC must be included. The following table indicates the correct approach for these fields.
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|}

\hline
\end{tabularx}

The \texttt{permID} and \texttt{provID}  fields carry the permanent or provisional designation of the object, respectively. (The past use of an MPC ``packed" designation has been dropped, primarily because it is generally less readable, and the sorting advantages of the packed format require preservation of leading blanks and zeros, which is not in accord with the IAU2015 formatting guidelines.) For minor planets and comets, the \texttt{permID} and \texttt{provID}  format follows the formal designation very closely, with the exception of removing parentheses around numbered minor planets and eschewing subscripting in provisional designations of minor planets. For comets, the formal \texttt{permID} and provID entries are identical, including the fragment descriptor. For planetary satellites the \texttt{permID} entry uses only the first letter of the planet followed by the Arabic number of the satellite. The specification of the permanent and provisional designation fields is given by examples in the following table:

The MPC1992 astrometry format recorded the date and time of observation in decimal day format. The IAU2015 standard breaks from that historical format to use the ISO 8601 standard date/time format. (See, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\verb|_|8601.) There are a number of advantages to this standard, including wide availability of libraries in many programming languages for input/output of the ISO 8601 time format, reduced ambiguity for times near leap-seconds, and human readability. Additionally, radar astrometry measurements (discussed below) are reported as normal points with a time tag at an integer UT second, and so are not well suited for decimal day representation. A key reason to prefer the decimal day form was that the MPC1992 observations use this format and the precision of the submitted time can be of interest in some cases. To address this need, the time precision of MPC1992 observation records will be preserved in the \texttt{precTime} field, allowing the end-user to reconstruct the decimal day string used in the original MPC1992 submission.

At the workshop there was a lengthy discussion on decimal vs. sexagesimal reporting of angles; however, the clear consensus was to opt for decimal \si{\degree}. The primary reasons for continuing with sexagesimal are a) existing data are already in sexagesimal format and alteration of submitted data is undesirable, and b) the sexagesimal format makes it convenient to plan the sequence of observations during an observing night (by reference to the local apparent sidereal time). The key justification for moving away from sexagesimal representation is that a) it is not suitable for automated data validation of astrometry records using standard computing tools, b) many routine data manipulations and database searches become cumbersome with sexagesimal, for example, selection of observations near a given position (for linkage problems), differencing of sequential positions, routine plotting, etc., c) bugs in the countless different implementations of decimal to sexagesimal conversion tools are persistent and frustrating (e.g., the negative declination bug or "60" appearing in the arcmin or \si{\arcsecond} position), and d) the data exchange standard should mirror the mass data storage format insofar as is practicable, again to avoid alteration of submitted data.

While some operational situations may require sexagesimal values, e.g., for telescope control, ephemeris generation services will continue to provide sexagesimal outputs on request. Typically, targeted observation planning is based on such tabular ephemerides, but in cases where observers refer to astrometric records to sequence observations the conversion to sexagesimal format is straightforward. The IAU2015 standard only specifies a mode of exchange, and users are free to repackage astrometry in whatever form is judged appropriate for local purposes.

The reported precision in archival MPC1992 data records will be preserved in the \texttt{precRA} and \texttt{precDec} fields, which may be useful for correct treatment of the observations and will allow an accurate reconstruction of the original MPC1992 RA and DEC field

<section name="Observation Residuals">
   <text>
Once an orbit is computed by fitting the observational data, some users may wish to exchange the information on the residuals as well as the information on the statistical treatment applied to the observations. These fields are usually filled by orbit computing centers and can be consulted by observers to assess their astrometric performance.  None of these fields is required for submitting astrometry to the MPC, nor is the MPC expected to store these data in case the observer provides them.

The inclusion of the residuals as part of the standard was discussed at length at the workshop. The reasons for including residuals in the astrometry exchange standard are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item	Residuals, at least for asteroids, are generally reflective of the observational errors and, especially for well constrained orbits, are not very sensitive to the dynamical model;
\item	Observers are interested in knowing the quality of their observations;
\item	Residuals afford an assessment of the internal consistency of a tracklet, which is not visible in the astrometry itself;
\item	Availability of residuals facilitates research on the statistical treatment of astrometry and photometry.
\end{itemize}

Residuals not only depend on the astrometric and photometric measurements but also on a specific trajectory, i.e., osculating orbit, dynamical model, and photometric model. This information is not captured explicitly in the present form of the data exchange standard, but is indirectly referenced through the orbId field.

<section name="Format and Packaging">
   <text>
After extensive discussion at the MPC workshop, a consensus was reached that the new standard should support two file formats. XML was selected as the primary vehicle for exchanging data, in large part because of its advantages for computer input/output applications. Among other modern data exchange standards, XML was judged to have the desired maturity and stability (in terms of standards, schema, user base and available libraries) in comparison to some more recent developments that are still evolving, e.g., JSON. XML files are more verbose than those of less flexible formats, but they typically afford excellent compression ratios (e.g., 10:1 and better), substantially mitigating file transmission issues.

However, XML is not suited for plain text viewing and editing, and thus a PSV format (i.e., Pipe Separated Value, similar to CSV) that carries the same information as the XML format will be supported by the standard, although exchange in this format is not encouraged. Rather, we consider it preferable for users to convert PSV files to XML after viewing and editing and before transmission. This has the advantage of automatic data validation and avoids issues with email line wrapping. We anticipate that tools allowing convenient viewing and editing of XML files will be developed by the research community, and that as these tools become available many PSV users will find it more convenient to work directly with XML.

Because of its inherent flexibility, there are no significant packaging challenges with XML. A data file may have only observations, only residuals, or both. Also an XML file may have multiple data types (e.g., radar, ground-based optical, space-based optical, occultation or offset observations) within a file without difficulty. And header information is readily absorbed into the XML file structure, even for multiple batches in a single file. Such flexibility can be preserved in the PSV file format, but not with the same elegance afforded by XML. 

The proposed standard will include open source I/O libraries in a number of programming languages, and conversion scripts to and from XML and PSV. This software will allow for robust error checking, file merging/splitting, and other utility functions. For the current version of the standard a requirement of lossless conversion between XML and PSV will be enforced, both for data records and submission headers.
   </text>
</section>

<subsection name="Primary Exchange Format \textemdash XML ">
   <text>
The exact formulation of the XML format is under development, but it should be similar to the example given in the figure below, where an \texttt{ObservationChunk} element includes an \texttt{obsContext} sub-element (i.e., the header) and an \texttt{observations} sub-element, which holds the observations. Multiple \texttt{ObservationChunk} blocks may be included in one submission file when, for example, the header information changes within a given submission. In the XML format users are discouraged from adding leading or trailing blanks. Keywords are written in so called lowerCamelCase, i.e., lowercase except that wordbreaks are marked by an uppercase letter. Initialisms and acronyms (e.g., ID, RA, SNR) are not written in mixed case.
   </text>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Secondary Exchange Format \textemdash PSV">
   <text>
Despite its advantages, XML is inconvenient for visual inspection of observation files and for manually editing records, which is sometimes required. Therefore the IAU2015 standard accommodates an alternate exchange format, namely a plain text Pipe Separated Values (PSV) file. (An example is depicted at right.) Blanks will normally be used as padding to obtain column alignment of the data fields, but this is not strictly necessary. Since the pipe character `\verb.|.' serves as delimiter it is not an allowed character in the fields defined by this standard. Null fields are empty (i.e., consecutive delimiters: `\verb.||.') or filled with blanks in the blank-padded format.

In the PSV format a submission batch includes a header block and one or more data blocks. Each data block starts with a keyword record that specifies the keywords and their order, followed by a series of data records that follow the structure of the keyword record. Multiple data blocks can follow a single header block, and multiple submission batches can be concatenated into one PSV file. The header information is generally optional, but mandatory for MPC submissions. The keyword record is a mandatory first record for any data block. 

The header section loosely follows the structure in the XML example above, but without the use of XML tags. The higher-level "group" keywords are preceded by a `\verb|#|' character and the lower-level "element" keywords are preceded by a `!' character. 
For example, 
\begin{verbatim}
# observers
! name P. Villa
! name F. Madero
# telescope
! aperture 1.5
! design Reflector
! detector CCD
# comment This is a comment. And it 
# comment can be quite long.
\end{verbatim}

New submission batches are distinguished by a new header block, and new data blocks are identified by their keyword records. Each data block can have a different keyword list, as defined by the corresponding keyword record. In this way, for instance, different data types (e.g., optical and radar) can be in the same file without necessarily including all possible fields on each data record. 

The first non-blank record following the header block must be a keyword record, a PSV record specifying the keywords and the order that they take in the current batch.  
\begin{verbatim}
KEY1 | KEY2 | KEY3 | ...
\end{verbatim}
To readily recognize the keyword record when parsing the file we require that the first keyword be \texttt{permID}, even when it has a null value. Thus, the keyword record is by having \texttt{permID} as the first six non-blank characters. 

After the keyword record, the observation data records are reported as
\begin{verbatim}
VALUE1 | VALUE2 | VALUE3 | ...
\end{verbatim}

For easier visual inspection and editing, the PSV file can optionally be blank-padded for column alignment. The blank padding can be extended to the keyword record, which will keep the keywords above their data columns, or the blank padding can include only the data records, which will generally lead to a more compact format.

{\em Default PSV:} As a convenience for some users, the standard does define a default PSV template that is compliant with the standard. This template will afford a human readable format that can be widely used for many basic astrometric submission purposes. The table at right lists the field names, their order and the field width for this default format. Any fields present in the record but not listed in the table will be placed in arbitrary order between the \texttt{notes} and \texttt{remarks} fields. (The first three records in the PSV example above use the default PSV form. The last three records in the example show an alternate form of blank padding.) With this format the record length is 156 characters (plus optional fields after the \texttt{notes} and any \texttt{remarks}). Conversion utilities will include the option to produce files with the default template. However, use of the default template is not required: the only requirement for submission is the compliance with the general standards detailed in this document.

<subsection name="Packaging">
   <text>
After adoption by the IAU and the MPC, IAU2015 will become the MPC's primary means of submission and dissemination and observers are strongly encouraged to adopt the new format as soon as practicable. (The 80-column MPC1992 format will be deprecated but continue to be accepted for an indefinite but limited time period.) The submission of IAU2015 observations to the MPC will be possible in three ways: Web form, cURL, and email (XML only).

The only acceptable format for email submission is anticipated to be XML, either compressed or uncompressed. For the observers who prefer the PSV format, a web interface to upload observation submissions will be provided. The backend engine of the web interface will convert the supplied data file to XML and validate it as a part of the ingestion pipeline at the MPC. The MPC will also disseminate the data in the XML form of the IAU2015 standard, eventually with the option of downloading the observation residual data and submission headers. Users may use local scripts or MPC web forms to convert from XML to PSV and back. Scripts will provide a user option to include or exclude header information when converting from XML to PSV format.

The observational data defined in Sec. 4 must be packaged within a single file. In particular, when satellite or roving observations are exchanged the information on the observer location must be contained in the same file as the observations, rather than in a separate file. On the other hand, the residuals and related fields may be included in the observation file or stored in a separate file. In the case of a single file, the observation residual fields have to be horizontally concatenated to the observational data and the residual header has to be vertically concatenated to the submission header. In the case of two different files, \texttt{obsID} should be reported on each record in the residual file to allow cross-referencing with the observation records.

<subsection>
   <text>
To support the transition to the new format, software tools will be made publicly available. An ad hoc volunteer software committee was formed at the MPC workshop. Co-chairs are A. Chamberlin and L. Denneau. Additional membership includes P. Chodas, T. Grav, S. Keys and A. Milani. The objective of this committee is to facilitate the development of software and libraries in a number of widely used languages, e.g., Perl, Python, FORTRAN, C++. The software packages will include I/O libraries for extending custom software and scripts for file utilities such as error checking, conversion (between PSV and XML), merging and splitting. 

Software packages should append a checksum value to the end of an XML file.  If provided, it should be the last line in the file and its value is the MD5 checksum of the file prior to appending the MD5 element onto it.  This can be used for submissions by curl to check if there was any corruption in the transmission of the file.  Upon receipt, the MPC would compute the MD5 checksum of the file without the line containing the MD5 element and report an error back to the submitter if the values disagreed.

Please note that potential users should not begin to write source code to accommodate the new exchange standard before communicating with the software committee. The standard will eventually include XML schema files and XSLT files for translation from XML to PSV, and the software committee will develop these as standard data products that will be under centralized control to ensure compliance with the standard. Also, numerous finer details remain to be resolved, many of which will not be obvious nor fully resolved until the software implementation is complete.

\section{Table of ADES Elements}
XML elements are the things which appear as XML tags, such as \verb|&lt;|permID\verb|&gt;| value \verb|&lt;/|permID\verb|&gt;|.  The ones in this table are all top-level elements, which means they can be the root of their own XML document and thus validated against XSD individually.   The last element in the table, ``ades," is intended to be used as the root element for every XML document used for interchange.  All elements are written in camelCase with the first character not capitalized.

\LTXtable{\textwidth}{elementstable.tex}

\section{Table of Restricted Simple Types}
Restricted simple types are a single XML value with some additional restrictions, such as requiring an decimal value to be in some range (such as 0.0 to 90.0) or requiring a string to be from an enumerated list.   Some of these restrictions, such as the possible station string values, will eventually be pulled out of MPC-provided files and referenced over the web.
