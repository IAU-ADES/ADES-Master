The Fortran 90 routines use FoX, a Fortran XML library available with a FreeBSD-like license.

To obtain Fox, go to 

https://github.com/andreww/fox

and download fox-master.zip from the download link

unzip this tarball, cd into fox-master and build it

To Build:
   step one is to ./configure
     Note you may need to edit the configure lines finding gfortran to find that language first.

   step two:  make and make check

Then the exmaples can be build using the Makefile



readxmlfox.f90 
writexmlfox.f90

are examples showing how to use FoX in fortran 90.

They do the pretty much the same job as writexmlpy/readxmlpy using lxml in python 
and writexmlc/readxmlc using -lxml2 in C.  These all use the same base lxml2
library.

Note FoX is confused about UTF-8 and any other non-ASCII encodings, because
Fortran does not handle those in a consistent way.
