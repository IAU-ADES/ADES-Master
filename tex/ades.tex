\section{Tables of ADES Tags and Structures}


\subsection{Table of ADES Elements}
XML elements are the things which appear as XML tags, such as \verb|<|permID\verb|>| value \verb|</|permID\verb|>|.  The ones in this table are all top-level elements, which means they can be the root of their own XML document and thus validated against XSD individually.   The last element in the table, ``ades," is intended to be used as the root element for every XML document used for interchange.  All elements are written in camelCase with the first character not capitalized.

\subsection{Table of Restricted Simple Types}
Restricted simple types are a single XML value with some additional restrictions, such as requiring an decimal value to be in some range (such as 0.0 to 90.0) or requiring a string to be from an enumerated list.   Some of these restrictions, such as the possible station string values, will eventually be pulled out of MPC-provided files and referenced over the web.
